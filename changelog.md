New Welcome Page

November 30, 2023

Introducing the new app welcome page! Here you'll find quick action buttons for creating a Note, importing documents to your library, a list of recently opened documents and a site-wide search menu.

You can now also index, import and extract info from websites directly inside Unriddle. Just click "Import", select "Paste URL" and then do just that! 

Improvements & Bug Fixes

Unriddle is now available in 30+ languages. To changes the language, go to the settings menu and select your preferred language. 

Chat has a new menu! Click the (⋯) menu to find options for copying and exporting the chat history and creating new conversations.

We swapped out some of the language models we're using behind the scenes to speed things up. In case you're interested in this stuff, we're now using a combination of Mistral 7b, Meta's Llama 70b and OpenAI's GPT.

Various UX improvements around layout and menu positioning. You might notice a few menus have moved around.

Fixed a bug where ungroup wasn't working for certain groups.

Export notes as PDF documents

November 12, 2023

Click the ellipses (⋯) menu in the top right corner of the screen in the text editor and then select "Export as PDF". Copy contents has also moved into this menu. And the text formatting menu has a new home! Select some text in the text editor and you'll see a menu appear with all your favourite formatting options and more.

Improved collaboration for teams

October 23, 2023

Users on the Teams plan can now share, interact with and edit the same documents. Get started by dragging an item into the "Team" area in the left sidebar.

Improvements & Bug Fixes

It's now much faster to delete, group and ungroup in the left sidebar.

We have a shiny new landing page. If you know someone who might find Unriddle useful, now might be a good time to share!

Fixed a bug where "<br>" was showing in autocompleted text.

Resolved bug where line breaks in AI generated text were not being maintained on edit.

Resolved a bug that was causing the related sidebar to show in tab and side view text edit panes when it shouldn't be.

Introducing graph view

October 11, 2023

It's a new way to explore connections between items in your library. Click the Graph icon in the left sidebar to visualise connections between things things you've read and written about. 

Circles represent items in your library and the lines are the relations made by Unriddle based on their meaning. Drag a circle to highlight its connections and click on one to navigate to that item's page.

Improvements & Bug Fixes

We're now running on Intercom! Click "support" at the top of the app to open up a chat with one of the team. Feel free to reach out at any time if you run into an issue, have a question about a feature or to just want to share feedback. 

Improved site-wide loading. Previously the default documents would remain in the sidebar for a few seconds while your chatbots loaded. No longer!

Added markdown support. In addition to PDFs and pasted text, Unriddle now support markdown imports, maintaining full styling.

Some Little Big Updates

October 3, 2023

Free user notes and documents are now automatically deleted after 30 days of inactivity. Paid user (Pro, Premium or Teams) data is unaffected and remains on our system until you hit delete.

Improvements 

Improved left sidebar UX — groups are collapsable, multi-select delete is now possible, and it’s easier to remove individual items from a group. Drag and drop coming soon!

Grouping and querying now work across both notes and documents. Previously this feature only worked on Documents. You can even edit notes directly in the group view. 

Improved side view. It's now much easier to open, close and navigate the text editor on the right-hand side of the app.

Bug Fixes

Resolved a bug where multiple menus were appearing at the same time in the sidebar.

Improved error handling in chat window.

Resolved bug where chat responses were some times hanging. 

Introducing Unriddle Teams

September 18, 2023

We're excited to announce a new payment plan that allows multiple seats on a single account! It’s $40 per seat per month and offers full Premium features with no usage limits for everyone on the account. Plus, it includes an admin panel where you can manage and revoke access.

Better Connections

September 8, 2023

In the last few days, we vastly improved the relevance of note and document linking, made it clearer why connections are being made and revamped the AI menu.

Unriddle often links notes you'd never have thought were related, making it a bit tricky to understand why certain items are showing in the related sidebar. Now it's super easy to see connection. Hover an item in the related sidebar and Unriddle will highlight the relevant text in the editor. See a demo here.

Previously, AI generated text was directly inserted into the bottom of text editor after selecting or entering a prompt. This implementation was temporary while we figured out if people found the feature useful. And it turns out they do! So we're glad to introduce a much improved version of the AI Menu. Now, after selecting a prompt, you can preview the response before either inserting, replacing or regenerating!

Hyperlink and image support added to the text editor.

Search your entire library by clicking the search icon in the left sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut cmd/ctrl + K.

Never Loose a Citation Again

August 23, 2023

We're taking the pain out of citations with our new "Cite" feature! Easily reference sources as you write, organise research, or take notes.

Just highlight some text, click 'Cite', and select the appropriate item from your library. Unriddle intelligently surfaces relevant documents first thanks to AI-powered meaning and context matching. The selected source then gets inserted as a clickable link.

The Cite menu streamlines adding citations on the fly so you can focus on the ideas instead of the tedious referencing workflow. No more scrambling to track down footnotes at the end. Or forgetting where a key detail was sourced from.

Keyboard Shortcuts

August 18, 2023

We added keyboard shortcuts! Some good ones to note:

cmd/ctrl + \\ to open/close the Left Sidebar

cmd/ctrl + / to open/close the Right Sidebar

cmd/ctrl + L to open the Cite menu

cmd/ctrl + J to open the AI menu

Find a full list here.

A Context-Aware Writing Experience

August 15, 2023

We're taking note organisation to the next level with AI-powered auto-linking! Unriddle now automatically connects related ideas across your library based on the meaning and context of what you read and write about.

Let's say you have a collection of nuclear physics papers in your library. When you start writing a note about The Manhattan Project, simply mentioning "The Manhattan Project" will prompt Unriddle to find the connection between this note and the nuclear physics papers.

Even if you didn't explicitly mention the research papers, Unriddle's knowledge of Oppenheimer, his work, and the significant relevance of these papers means it understands the connection and automatically links them together.

More Credits for All

August 9th, 2023

It now costs 1 credit to create a note, upload a document or send a message. We added Notes to the list and made Chrome Extension summaries unlimited for paid users. 

With these changes we’re updating the credit limits:

Premium users now have unlimited credits!

Pro user credits have increased from 100 to 150 per month.

Free users have double the credits from 5 to 10 per month.

You can find the full details on our brand new pricing page.

Introducing the Text Editor

August 6, 2023

We're excited to announce the addition of a full-featured text editor within the app! Easily write essays, take notes and organise your thoughts without leaving your research workspace. 

Click ‘New’ in the sidebar and hit ‘Note’ to open up a new document. Here you’ll find all the text formatting options you’re used to and more. You can open up any note in a pane on the right side of the screen. Click the orange pencil icon at the top of the chat window to get started.

The text editor is AI-enabled too! Type ‘++’ to generate text based on the context of what’s already written in the note. Highlight text and click ‘Ask AI’ to open up the AI menu where you’ll find options to improve, expand, summarize and explain.

Merging is Now Free

July 25, 2023

It no longer costs any credits to use the merge feature. So feel free to group and ungroup documents as much as you want!

Not familiar with the merge feature? Select documents from the sidebar, hit merge and then query for info across the group. People are using this feature to support the literature review process, compare legal docs, review congressional hearing transcripts and more.

Improvements

You can now upload up to 10 documents at once. Drag and drop a selection or click to upload and select multiple.

We launched an affiliate program. Refer Unriddle to your friends and followers, and earn 20% of the first payment made by anyone who signs up through your link. And there's no limit to how much you can earn. Learn more here.

Bug Fixes

Changed sidebar sorting to chronological order. Previously grouped documents were pinned to the top; now all documents appear in the order they were created.

Resolved a bug where renaming was not working on click away.

Multi-AI Chat

July 11, 2023

You can now engage multiple AIs at once for a more powerful research experience. Simply type ‘@’ in the chat input, select ‘ChatGPT’ and enter a prompt. 

ChatGPT is trained on a massive dataset of text, which includes books, articles and websites. This allows it to provide high-level answers on almost any topic, so use it to look up info that isn’t contained in the document but that might be relevant to your research. It’s setup like a group chat, so no matter which AI you’re speaking with they all have access to the context of the current conversation. 

Improvements & Bug Fixes

Resolved a bug where page number references were appearing for bots generated with pasted text. These bots don’t have pages, so there are no pages to link to.

Fixed a bug where the "Manage Billing" button wasn't showing for some users.

Now Optimised for Mobile 

June 25, 2023

We're excited to announce that the site is now fully optimised for small screens! Seamlessly upload, query, and merge documents from any device.

We also added a new right sidebar which includes sections for user account info, credit usage and model settings. The previous implementation (account menu dropdown) was getting pretty messy and hard to navigate!

Improvements & Bug Fixes

Model settings have been moved from local storage to the database, so they now persist across devices and browsers.

Improved error handling with the “Paste file link” upload method since certain sites (e.g. PubMed) have started blocking other servers from downloading their content. For now, the way to get these document into unriddle is to download it yourself and then upload it to unriddle via the “Select file” button.

Resolved a bug with the “Paste file link” upload method where in certain cases documents were not being fetched correctly.

Performance Boost

June 18, 2023

This release brings major speed and stability improvements. We've implemented a new vector store and indexing system, enabling lightning-fast response times. The chat interface has been revamped too — responses now display in easy-to-read Markdown formatting with support for code snippets.

Improvements

Improved select menu UX. Previously, when you selected multiple documents in the sidebar a menu appeared at the top of the list, pushing each item down. This was jarring and made it difficult to see how many items were selected so I moved the menu out of the sidebar and to the bottom of the screen.

Page source references now follow the Digital ACM format e.g. [10].

The chat text input now wraps, making it much easier to paste text and write long prompts.

Added a stop button which interrupts response streaming when clicked.

Bug Fixes

Resolved a bug that caused the site to intermittently crash. This was due to issues with unriddle’s hosting provider so we switched to a different one and I’m glad to share we haven’t experienced an outage since.

Fixed a bug that caused the draggable split window slider to stop working when navigating from one bot to another.

Fixed a bug that caused duplicate Stripe payments.

Credit System

May 24, 2023

We implemented a credit system to ensure resources are distributed evenly between paying users. You don’t need to do anything for the changes to take effect.

Here’s how it works:

Free users get 5 credits per month.

Pro users get 100 credits per month ($20 per mo).

Premium users get 250 credits per month ($50 per mo).

It costs one credit each time you create a chatbot, send a message, merge chatbots or generate a summary with the Chrome extension.

If you signed up for a paid plan before May 24th 2023 the credit limit won't be enforced for the remainder of May. For those who purchase a plan after May 24th, the credit limit is active from sign-up. You can find the full details on the pricing page.

Full Model Customisation

May 11, 2023

This release introduces new personalisation settings to customise your experience. You can now adjust the AI model, temperature, and response length by accessing the settings menu in the top right corner.

Model. Choose between GPT-3.5 for faster yet simpler responses, or GPT-4 for more advanced intelligence.

Temperature. Set the creativity level of responses on a scale from 0 to 1. Lower temperatures yield more repetitive answers, while higher allows more creative license.

Max Length. Define the approximate maximum word count for AI-generated responses. This acts as a guide rather than a hard limit.

These settings apply across all documents, allowing you to easily customise the AI to suit your needs, whether that's retrieving factual information or exploring creative ideas. And you can quickly toggle between settings at any time, regardless of what was chosen when documents were uploaded.

Got feedback or questions? Send us an email and we'll get back to you within a day.
